Idea 1

A person is standing with a balloon in his hand. The number of balloons will increase gradually.  
When the balloons number reaches 20, the person will start leaving the ground. If you click the mouse to poke the balloon, the number of balloons will decrease, 
you need to click all the balloons in time to save the person. Otherwise the person will fly up and disappear. 
But if you happen to click all the balls when the person is in the air, the person will scream “ Nooooooo”.
